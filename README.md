# spinner

A simple text spinner for command line Clojure apps.

What is it useful for?

To give the user of a command line app a simple indeterminate progress indicator for long running operations.
Supports output of additional messages while a spinner is active.

Here it is in action (from the unit tests):

## Installation

spinner is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/spinner).
Plonk the following in your project.clj :dependencies, substitute "#.#.#" for the latest version number,
`lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
[org.clojars.pmonks/spinner "#.#.#"]
```

The latest version is:

[![version](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/spinner/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.pmonks/spinner)

## Usage

The spinner functionality is provided by the `spinner.core` namespace.

Require it in the REPL:

```clojure
(require '[spinner.core :as spin] :reload-all)
```

Require it in your application:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [spinner.core :as spin]))
```

**Important Note:** your REPL must be run in a trampoline (`lein trampoline repl`) in order for ANSI escape sequences to be available.

[The API documentation](https://pmonks.github.io/spinner/) has full details on the functionality provided by the library, and [the unit tests](https://github.com/pmonks/spinner/blob/master/test/spinner/core_test.clj) have several examples of usage.
